# Welcome to Onliine!
The best website that simulates the Wii System to the perfection (almost).

## Collaborations
I'm open to collaborations! Come and join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/qMdZZkps2E)
for the project and have a chat with all of us enthusiasts of this project.

## Status
This project is on its early phase of development, meaning that is quite incomplete,
might contain errors, poorly written code and will not focus on performance at the moment.
Thus, it's a great to start and evolve into something bigger, like a Dolphin VM built into
WebAssembly (ðŸ˜³), or a real working Wii Shop Channel to download all sorts of apps.
